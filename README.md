# Colorectal-Cancer-Graduation-Project

Colorectal Cancer Classification, Detection and Analysis
•	Developed and implemented deep learning models to accurately classify and detect cancer polyps with a success rate of 99%, 85% for classification and detection, reducing the need for invasive procedures by 50%.
•	Designed and executed a deep learning model using transfer learning to classify histopathology tissue images, resulting in an increase in accurate diagnosis by 30% compared to traditional methods.
•	Utilized data mining techniques and implemented an algorithm to identify genes with mutations associated with cancer, leading to potential early detection of colorectal cancer.
•	Developed and optimized a comprehensive database system with efficient functions and triggers, facilitating seamless data retrieval and analysis for medical professionals.
